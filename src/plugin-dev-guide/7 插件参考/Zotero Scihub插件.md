#### DNS-over-HTTPS

In case of malfunctioning or unsafe local DNS server, Zotero (as it's built on Firefox) might be configured with [Trusted Recursive Resolver](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Trusted_Recursive_Resolver) or DNS-over-HTTPS, where you could set your own DNS server just for Zotero without modifying network settings.

*Preferences > Advanced > Config Editor*

1.  set network.trr.mode to 2 or 3, this enables DNS-over-HTTPS (2 enables it with fallback)
2.  set network.trr.uri to https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query, this is the provider’s URL
3.  set network.trr.bootstrapAddress to 1.1.1.1, this is cloudflare’s normal DNS server (only) used to retrieve the IP of cloudfaire-dns.com
4.  Restart zotero, wait for a DNS cache to clean up.
